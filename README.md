## Adding additional language support

To add support for another language, copy the [`en/`](en/) directory and translate each of the files without changing the file names. Then modify this file and the `README.md` file found in each of the subdirectories with a language entry to point to the appropriate file in the new directory. New language files are not to be added in any of the existing subdirectories, only the introduced language-specific directory.
