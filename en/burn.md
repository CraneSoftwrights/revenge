In [this `burn/` directory](../burn) in the repository are the SVG, PDF, and PNG directories of files used in the creation of final play products.

Only the generated PNG preview files are preserved within the repository, not either the SVG nor PDF files (see below). It is important to pull the results of pushing changes to the server in order to refresh the PNG preview files.

The associated SVG and PDF files are in the corresponding `burn/` directories of the ZIP file created for both the action results (after every push) and the releases (after every push to the develop, qa, and main branches). Unzip those files in order to get the burn files used on the laser cutter.

The files in this directory are created during the [build process documented here](build.md).
