These are the outputs generated for Crane's Revenge at Hay Lake game,
maintained publicly in https://github.com/CraneSoftwrights/revenge

The PDF files are suitable for a laser cutter where cut directives are
lines with the width .001in. For distinction, these lines are magenta
coloured. All other lines are simply burned on the wood surface.

Directories in this ZIP:

 burn/ - a set of finalized SVG, PDF, and PNG files of the game surfaces
         including print, single-board, double-board, and multi-layer builds

 cuts/ - a set of pre-packaged cut files used to create smaller wooden blanks
         from larger wooden blanks

One SVG file in particular is a summary of all of the burn files, useful 
in Inkscape to review the individual layers:

  burn/svg/review-all-burns-revenge-crane.svg 

All surface dimensions are 10"x10" (254mm x 254mm) but the burning area fits a
centred 250mm x 250mm space (just don't align the 250mm box into the corner of
the 254mm box; make sure it is centred).

Surface naming conventions are as follows:

 - Print - board front for printing on paper
 - SBF and SBB - single board front and back for burning one layer of material
 - DBF and DBB - double board front and back for burning two layers of material
 - L1 through L5, L9 - for burning six layers of material
